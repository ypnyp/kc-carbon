# Keycloak Carbon

A theme for Keycloak, based off IBM [Carbon Design](https://carbondesignsystem.com/), that was referenced from [GOV.UK](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/keycloak-theme-govuk).

This is a continuation with tweaks for the Yipnyap Brand to [httpsOmkar](https://github.com/httpsOmkar/carbon-keycloak-theme)'s theme.

# Note
There's some elements (like the logo on the top-left) that is not following the Carbon Design System on purpose. Our brand requires that the logo is visible on all official pages on the top navbar either on the far left or center. You can change this behaviour in your Keycloak Realm and changing the display HTML field.
